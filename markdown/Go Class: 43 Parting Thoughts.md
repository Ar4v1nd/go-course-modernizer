# Go Class: 43 Parting Thoughts

## Summary
This video concludes a Go programming course by offering parting thoughts on software engineering principles, Go-specific proverbs, recommended learning resources, and the importance of continuous learning for a successful career in technology. The speaker emphasizes clarity over cleverness, simplicity in design, and the value of ongoing self-development.

## Key Points

*   **Go Proverbs and Clarity:**
    *   "Clear is better than clever" is the most important Go proverb.
    *   In software engineering, "clever" code (e.g., complex one-liners) is often seen as an accusation, not a compliment.
    *   The goal is to write readable and maintainable programs.

*   **Simplicity in Software Design:**
    *   Tony Hoare's quote highlights two approaches to software design: making it "so simple that there are *obviously* no deficiencies" or "so complicated that there are no *obvious* deficiencies."
    *   The aim is to build software that is *obviously* correct and good.
    *   "Elegant simplicity" is a desirable trait in software.
    *   "Elegant complexity" is a trap that often leads to failed projects and wasted resources.
    *   Apply Occam's Razor: build only what is necessary and introduce abstractions or complexity only when absolutely required.

*   **Recommended Non-Go Software Engineering Talks:**
    *   "Simple made easy" by Rich Hickey (QCon 2012)
    *   "Small is beautiful" by Kevlin Henney (GOTO 2016)
    *   "Software that fits in your head" by Dan North (GOTO 2016)
    *   "Worse is better, for better or for worse" by Kevlin Henney (GOTO 2013)
    *   "Solid snakes or How to take 5 weeks of vacation" by Hynek Schlawack (PyCon 2017)
    *   These talks, while not Go-specific, offer fundamental principles applicable to building robust and maintainable software in any language, including Go.

*   **Go Learning Resources:**
    *   A GitHub repository, `matt4biz/go-resources`, is provided as a curated list of learning materials.
    *   It includes books, blog posts, videos (especially from past GopherCons), and resources related to cloud software development and general software engineering.
    *   The repository is public, and contributions are encouraged.

*   **Goals: Never Stop Learning:**
    *   Continuous learning is paramount for a long and valuable career in software development.
    *   Adapt to new technologies and paradigms (e.g., moving from punch cards and Fortran to Go and cloud development).
    *   Develop new skills and technologies, rather than just relying on past knowledge.
    *   Consider changing roles or companies if opportunities for learning and growth are limited.
    *   Share knowledge by teaching others, as it reinforces your own understanding and helps the community grow.
    *   The speaker plans to follow this foundational Go class with a new series on building web applications in Go, covering topics like basic REST APIs, databases, GraphQL, and testing.

## What's New
Based on the provided Go release notes and the specified evaluation criteria (only "Changes to the language", "Tools", and "Standard library" sections, focusing on factual points about Go syntax, behavior, deprecation, tooling, etc., and ignoring opinions, philosophies, or general design principles), none of the key points in the "Key Points" section are affected by changes in Go versions 1.16 through 1.24. The key points provided are high-level advice, recommendations, or philosophical statements, which fall outside the scope of the evaluation.
