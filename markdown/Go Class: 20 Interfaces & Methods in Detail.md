# Go Class: 20 Interfaces & Methods in Detail

## Summary
This video delves into the intricate details of interfaces and methods in Go, focusing on concepts like nil interfaces, pointer vs. value receivers, method values, and best practices for designing and using interfaces effectively. It highlights common pitfalls, such as the "nil interface holding a nil concrete pointer" issue, and explains how Go's type system handles method calls on different receiver types. The video also introduces functional programming concepts like currying to explain method values and concludes with practical guidelines for interface design.

## Key Points

### Nil Interfaces
- An interface variable is `nil` until initialized.
- An interface internally consists of two parts: a value/pointer to the concrete type and a pointer to type information.
- An interface variable is `nil` only if *both* its value part and type part are `nil`.
- If an interface variable is assigned a nil pointer of a concrete type (e.g., `var b *bytes.Buffer; var r io.Reader; r = b`), the interface itself is *not* `nil` because its type part is set (e.g., `*bytes.Buffer`), even if its value part is `nil`.
- This distinction can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when comparing an interface to `nil`.

### Error is Really an Interface
- The built-in `error` type in Go is actually an interface:
  ```go
  type error interface {
      func Error() string
  }
  ```
- A common mistake is to return a nil pointer to a concrete error type in an `error` interface variable.
- If a function returns `*MyError` (a pointer to a custom error struct) and the pointer is `nil`, assigning this to an `error` interface variable will result in a non-nil interface (because the type information `*MyError` is present), even though the underlying concrete value is `nil`.
- This means `if err != nil` might evaluate to `true` even if the underlying error value is `nil`, leading to unexpected error handling.
- To avoid this, always return `nil` directly when there is no error, rather than a nil pointer to a concrete type.

### Pointer vs. Value Receivers
- Methods can be defined on either a value type (`T`) or a pointer type (`*T`).
- A method with a value receiver operates on a copy of the receiver; changes to the receiver inside the method are not reflected in the original variable.
- A method with a pointer receiver operates on the original receiver; changes made inside the method affect the original variable.
- Go automatically handles dereferencing (`*`) and taking addresses (`&`) when calling methods.
    - If you have a pointer `p` to a type `T` and call a method defined on `T`, Go will automatically dereference `p` (e.g., `(*p).Method()`).
    - If you have a value `v` of type `T` and call a method defined on `*T`, Go will automatically take the address of `v` (e.g., `(&v).Method()`).
- This automatic conversion only works if the object is *addressable* (an L-value). You cannot take the address of an R-value (e.g., a literal or the result of an expression that doesn't return a variable).

### Consistency in Receiver Types
- If one method of a type takes a pointer receiver, then generally *all* its methods should take pointer receivers.
- This is especially true for types that are not safe to copy (e.g., structs containing slices, maps, channels, or mutexes), as copying them might lead to unexpected behavior or data races.
- Using consistent pointer receivers helps reinforce the idea that the type should not be copied.

### Currying Functions
- Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.
- In Go, this can be demonstrated by a function that returns another function, where the outer function "binds" one of the arguments.
  ```go
  func Add(a, b int) int {
      return a + b
  }

  func AddToA(a int) func(int) int {
      return func(b int) int {
          return Add(a, b)
      }
  }

  // Example usage:
  // addToOne := AddToA(1)
  // result := addToOne(2) // result is 3
  ```

### Method Values
- A method value is created by selecting a method from a concrete value (or pointer to a value) without calling it.
- When a method value is created, the receiver is "closed over" (captured) at that point.
- If the method has a value receiver, the receiver's value is *copied* into the method value. Subsequent changes to the original receiver variable will *not* affect the method value.
- If the method has a pointer receiver, a *pointer* to the receiver is copied into the method value. Subsequent changes to the original receiver variable *will* affect the method value.
  ```go
  type Point struct {
      x, y float64
  }

  func (p Point) Distance(q Point) float64 { // Value receiver
      return math.Hypot(q.x-p.x, q.y-p.y)
  }

  func (p *Point) Add(x, y float64) { // Pointer receiver
      p.x += x
      p.y += y
  }

  // Example:
  // p := Point{1, 1}
  // q := Point{5, 4}
  // distanceFromP := p.Distance // Method value with value receiver (p is copied)
  // fmt.Println(distanceFromP(q)) // Uses p={1,1}

  // p.Add(1, 1) // Changes p to {2,2}
  // fmt.Println(distanceFromP(q)) // Still uses p={1,1} because it was copied when distanceFromP was created
  ```

### Interfaces in Practice
1.  **Let consumers define interfaces**: The code that *uses* an interface should define it, specifying only the minimal behavior it requires. This promotes loose coupling.
2.  **Re-use standard interfaces wherever possible**: Go's standard library provides many useful interfaces (e.g., `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`, `fmt.Stringer`). Using these promotes interoperability.
3.  **Keep interface declarations small**: Smaller interfaces are easier to satisfy and lead to weaker (more flexible) abstractions. The Go proverb: "The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction."
4.  **Compose one-method interfaces into larger interfaces (if needed)**: Instead of defining a large interface directly, combine smaller, single-method interfaces (e.g., `io.ReadWriterCloser` is composed of `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`, `io.Closer`).
5.  **Avoid coupling interfaces to particular types/implementations**: Interfaces should describe behavior, not implementation details.
6.  **Accept interfaces, but return concrete types**:
    *   **Accept interfaces**: When a function takes parameters, accept the least restrictive interface that provides the necessary behavior. This allows the caller maximum flexibility in providing concrete types.
    *   **Return concrete types**: When a function returns a value, return a concrete type rather than an interface. This allows the consumer of the return value to use all the methods available on the concrete type, even those not part of an interface. The consumer can then decide how to use it, including assigning it to a more specific interface if needed.
    *   **Exception**: Returning `error` is a common exception to the "return concrete types" rule, as `error` is a fundamental interface for error handling.

### Empty Interfaces
- The `interface{}` type has no methods.
- Because it has no methods, it is satisfied by *anything*. Any concrete type can be assigned to an `interface{}` variable.
- Empty interfaces are commonly used in Go, for example, in formatted I/O routines like `fmt.Printf`, which can print any type of argument.
- When using empty interfaces, reflection is often needed to determine the concrete type of the value stored within the interface at runtime. This allows for dynamic type checking and manipulation.
