# Go Class: 37 Static Analysis

## Summary
This video introduces static analysis in Go programming, emphasizing its role in improving code readability and maintainability. It covers essential Go tools like `gofmt`, `goimports`, `golint`, and `go vet`, explaining their functions and how they contribute to code hygiene. The video also highlights `golangci-lint` as a comprehensive solution for integrating multiple static analysis tools into development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Points

*   **Introduction to Static Analysis**
    *   Static analysis (or linting) involves inspecting code without running it, typically at compile time.
    *   It's a set of tools and practices that improve code quality by offloading mental effort from developers and code reviewers.
    *   Benefits include enhanced correctness, efficiency, readability, and maintainability of code.

*   **Reading Culture and Maintainability**
    *   Go emphasizes a "reading culture," where code is optimized for clarity to the reader, as code is read far more often than it is written.
    *   Readability directly contributes to maintainability.

*   **Core Formatting Tools: `gofmt` and `goimports`**
    *   `gofmt`: Automatically formats Go source code according to standard Go style (spacing, indentation).
    *   `goimports`: Extends `gofmt` by also adding missing imports and removing unused ones.
    *   Best practice: Run `gofmt` or `goimports` automatically on every file save within your IDE/editor or as a pre-commit hook to ensure consistent formatting and clean imports.

*   **Stylistic Linter: `golint`**
    *   Checks for non-format style issues based on community guidelines like "Effective Go" and Google's Go Code Review Comments.
    *   Examples of issues `golint` checks for:
        *   Exported names should have comments for `godoc`.
        *   Names shouldn't use underscores or be in ALLCAPS (unless they are acronyms).
        *   `panic` shouldn't be used for normal error handling.
        *   Error flow should be indented, the happy path not.
        *   Variable declarations shouldn't have redundant type information.

*   **Bug Finder: `go vet`**
    *   Identifies suspicious constructs that the Go compiler won't necessarily flag as errors but are likely bugs or problematic patterns.
    *   Examples of issues `go vet` finds:
        *   Suspicious `printf` format strings (e.g., `%s` with an `int` argument).
        *   Accidentally copying a mutex type.
        *   Possibly invalid integer shifts.
        *   Possibly invalid atomic assignments.
        *   Possibly invalid struct tags.
        *   Unreachable code.
    *   Important note: No static analysis tool (including `go vet`) can find all possible errors in a program.

*   **Other Useful Static Analysis Tools**
    *   `goconst`: Finds literal constants that should be declared with `const`.
    *   `gosec`: Looks for possible security issues.
    *   `ineffassign`: Finds assignments that are ineffective because the assigned value is immediately overwritten without being read. This often indicates a missed error handling.
        ```go
        prices, err := r.prices(region, ...)
        regularPrices, err := r.regularPrices(region, ...) // ineffectual assignment to err
        if err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("price not available for region %s", region)
        }
        ```
    *   `gocyclo`: Reports high cyclomatic complexity in functions, suggesting they might be too complex and should be refactored into smaller, simpler functions.
    *   `deadcode`, `unused`, `varcheck`: Find unused or dead code.
    *   `unconvert`: Finds redundant type conversions.
    *   Some of these tools might produce "false positives" (warnings that aren't actual issues in context). These can often be suppressed with `//nolint` comments, ideally with an explanation.

*   **Unified Linting with `golangci-lint`**
    *   `golangci-lint` is a popular meta-linter that aggregates and runs many individual Go linters.
    *   It can be configured using a `.golangci.yml` file to enable/disable specific linters and set their options.
    *   It's commonly integrated into CI/CD pipelines to enforce code quality standards. Issues reported by `golangci-lint` typically must be fixed for the build to pass.

*   **IDE Integration**
    *   Modern Go IDEs and editors (like Visual Studio Code and Jetbrains GoLand) offer robust integration with static analysis tools.
    *   They can be configured to run `gofmt`, `goimports`, `go vet`, and `golangci-lint` automatically on file save, providing immediate feedback to the developer.
    *   This proactive approach helps maintain code hygiene from the very beginning of a project, adhering to the "start clean, stay clean" principle.

## What's New

*   **Core Formatting Tools: `gofmt` and `goimports`**
    *   `gofmt` now synchronizes `//go:build` lines with `// +build` lines. [2]
    *   `gofmt` now processes input files concurrently, leading to faster formatting on multi-CPU machines. [3]
    *   `gofmt` now reformats doc comments to make their rendered meaning clearer. [4]

*   **Bug Finder: `go vet`**
    *   `go vet` has introduced several new warnings:
        *   Invalid `testing.T` use in goroutines (e.g., `t.Fatal`). [1]
        *   `amd64` assembly that clobbers the BP register without saving/restoring. [1]
        *   Incorrectly passing non-pointer or nil arguments to `asn1.Unmarshal` (similar to `encoding/json.Unmarshal`). [1]
        *   Calls to `signal.Notify` on unbuffered channels. [2]
        *   `Is`, `As`, and `Unwrap` methods on error types with incorrect signatures. [2]
        *   `errors.As` called with a second argument of type `*error`. [4]
        *   Incorrect `time` formats (e.g., `2006-02-01` for `yyyy-mm-dd`). [5]
        *   Missing values after `append` (e.g., `slice = append(slice)`). [6]
        *   Non-deferred calls to `time.Since` within a `defer` statement. [6]
        *   Mismatched key-value pairs in `log/slog` calls. [6]
    *   The `printf` checker in `go vet` has improved precision, including tracking formatting strings created by concatenating string constants [3], and now reports diagnostics for non-constant format strings without other arguments [9].
    *   The `copylock` analyzer in `go vet` now reports diagnostics for `sync.Locker` types used in 3-clause `for` loops, reflecting the Go 1.22 language change where loop variables are created anew for each iteration. [9]
    *   The `stdversion` analyzer has been added to `go vet`, flagging references to symbols too new for the Go version specified in the `go.mod` file. [8]
    *   The behavior of `go vet` regarding references to loop variables from within function literals has changed. For code requiring Go 1.22 or newer, `go vet` no longer reports these as potential bugs because Go 1.22 changed the language semantics for `for` loops to create new variables for each iteration, avoiding accidental sharing bugs. [7]
    *   A new `tests` analyzer reports common mistakes in declarations of tests, fuzzers, benchmarks, and examples. [9]
